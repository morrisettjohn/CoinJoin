It's 9 o'clock on a Saturday, regular crowd shuffles in.  There's an old man sittin' next to me, making love to his tonic and gin.He says 'son can you play me a memory'? I'm not really sure how it goes.But it's sad and its sweet and I knew it complete when I wore a younger man's clothes.la la la di di dah, la la di di dahhhhhh da da
